# MLB Player Hitting Breakdown By Fielding Position

## What It Is
This application breaks down any MLB player's hitting statistics by their fielding position

## Why I Made This
To see which MLB players have significantly different hitting statistics when playing a different position

## But Really, Why?
When I was ten years old my favorite baseball player was Red Sox first baseman Brian Daubach. The first two Red Sox games I watched he hit home runs. I loved how often the camera went to him when the Red Sox were fielding because the first baseman is involved in a lot of plays.
In 2002 the Red Sox claimed Detroit Tigers All-Star first baseman Tony Clark. This meant most games Daubach was either in the outfield or coming in as the DH. I was adamant that Daubach hit worse when he didn't get to field and that he played his best when he got to be involved in more defensive action at first base. My issues with the change were compounded by Clark having a batting average of .207 in Daubach's place.
Back then I couldn't get the actual stats to back up my claim and I couldn't find any breakdowns of how a player hits based on fielding position.
